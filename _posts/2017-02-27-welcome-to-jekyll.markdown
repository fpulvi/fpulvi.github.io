This space is meant to be my Data Analysis portfolio. 
In the last month I have been less busy with the PhD stuffs. For this reason I decided to dive into data analysis in order to:
- play with state of the art data analysis and machine learning libraries
- have fun, trying to answer some of the questions I have been asking myself in the last years
- a little bit of show-off of my capacities and, above all, my creativity!

I am currently looking for a Data Scientist position!
